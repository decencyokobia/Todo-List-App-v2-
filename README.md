# Todo List App (v2)

This is my second iteration of a Todo List application. The goal was to enhance the design, improve user experience, and add some animations for a more engaging interface. It's built using [HTML, CSS, and JavaScript].

## Features

- **Create, Edit, and Delete Tasks**  
  Add new tasks, edit existing ones, or delete tasks as needed.
  
- **Task Completion**  
  Mark tasks as completed with a simple click.

- **Animated Transitions**  
  Enjoy smooth animations for deleting tasks.

- **Responsive Design**  
  The app is fully responsive, providing a good experience across devices like mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: To style the app with a clean and modern look.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the functionality, including adding tasks, marking them as completed, and saving data.
- **Animations**: Implemented with CSS.

## Installation

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```

3. Open `index.html` in your browser.

## How It Works

- **Adding Tasks**: To add a task, type your task into the input field and press "Add".
- **Marking Tasks as Completed**: Click the task to toggle its completion state. Completed tasks will be crossed out.
- **Deleting Tasks**: You can delete a task by clicking the " üóëÔ∏è " button next to it.

## Future Enhancements

- Add more animations.
- Include a filter option (All, Active, Completed).
- Implement dark mode for better accessibility.
