# Todo List App (v2)

This is my second iteration of a Todo List application. The goal was to enhance the design, improve user experience, and add some animations for a more engaging interface. It's built using [HTML, CSS, and JavaScript].

## Features

- **Create, Edit, and Delete Tasks**  
  Add new tasks, edit existing ones, or delete tasks as needed.
  
- **Task Completion**  
  Mark tasks as completed with a simple click.

- **Animated Transitions**  
  Enjoy smooth animations for deleting tasks.

- **Responsive Design**  
  The app is fully responsive, providing a good experience across devices like mobiles, tablets, and desktops.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For the structure of the app.
- **CSS**: To style the app with a clean and modern look.
- **JavaScript**: To handle the functionality, including adding tasks, marking them as completed, and saving data.
- **Animations**: Implemented with CSS.

## Demo

You can check out a live version of the app here: [Link to Live Demo](#)

## How It Works

## Future Enhancements
